**Contact Management System:**

**Idea:** A program to manage a list of contacts, including adding, updating, and
deleting contacts.

**Tasks:**

• Add new contacts with details like name, phone number, and email.
• Search for contacts by name or phone number.
• Edit contact details.
• Delete contacts.

**Evaluation:**

• Use Map or Record to store contact information.
• Implement search and update functionality with functional programming
techniques.

• Create a Windows Forms UI for managing contacts.

**Notes:**

The programming language you will use is F#, which is part of the .NET framework.
It’s powerful for solving problems using functional programming techniques (as you
know).
The UI (User Interface) will be created using Windows Forms in F#. This will allow
you to design windows where users can click buttons, enter text, and interact with
the system.
You will be using Functional Programming concepts such as:
• Immutable data: Data that cannot be changed once it's created.
• First-class functions: Functions that can be passed around like any other value.
• Pattern matching: A way to handle different types of data or cases easily.
You will also use GitHub to manage and store your code. GitHub helps you:
• Track changes to your code.
• Collaborate with others and share your work.
• Organize your projects and keep them safe.
